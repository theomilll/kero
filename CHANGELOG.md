# Changelog

All notable changes to kero. This file is the **source of truth for the release
notes shown in the in-app updater**: [`scripts/release.ts`](scripts/release.ts)
extracts the section whose heading matches the version being released
(`MARKETING_VERSION`) and publishes it next to the update, so Sparkle shows it in
the update prompt.

Format follows [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com). Add a new
`## [<version>]` section at the top for each release, matching the version you
set in the Xcode project.

## [unrelease]

- Opening the Ctrl-Tab switcher no longer highlights whichever tab happens to be under the stationary pointer
- The Processes list no longer shows `<defunct>` entries: those are exited children waiting to be reaped, not something you can see output from or kill
- Opening a large diff no longer freezes the window: diffs render only the rows on screen and highlight them off the main thread
- The font setting now applies to the diff viewer too, so diffs match the terminal and the editor
- Sessions you never open no longer cost any GPU memory. Reopening a window used to draw every restored session straight away, holding a full-size buffer for each whether you looked at it or not; now a pane claims one only when you first view it, and claims one buffer less than before. A pane you have already viewed keeps its buffer until you close it — switching away stops it drawing, but does not hand the memory back.

## [0.1.25]

- Add a tab switcher (ctrl-tab) to switch between tabs
- Add audio input support for CLIs that might need it

## [0.1.24]

- set TERM_PROGRAM to ghostty to get image rendering support

## [0.1.23]

- Fix pasting clipboard images into image-aware TUIs such as Grok, and paste Finder-copied files as shell-safe absolute paths (#20)

## [0.1.22]

- Add “Open in Kero” to Finder’s folder context menu, opening each selected folder as a project with its terminal started there
- Full-screen programs with their own background color (vim, htop, TUIs) now fill the terminal pane: the padding around the grid takes on the adjacent content's background instead of always showing the theme background, leaving only a hairline frame at the pane edges
- Fix non-ASCII rendering in git diff view
- Allow to rename session tabs

## [0.1.21]

- Anchor the file tree and Git panel to the project directory — the closest git repository containing the terminal's directory — so they no longer re-root every time you `cd` inside a repo; outside a repository they keep following the terminal as before
- Add "Set Project Directory…" to the project's context menu to pin a fixed directory for these panels ("Use Automatic Directory" reverts); the pin is remembered across relaunches
- Info panel: the Directory section is now split into Current Directory (the shell's live cwd, shown when it differs) and Project Directory, marked "(AUTO)" while derived automatically, with a "?" popover explaining both modes
- Remember sidebar layout across relaunches: each window restores whether the left and right sidebars were open and which right panel (Files/Git/Info) was selected

## [0.1.20]

- Security: stop terminal programs from silently reading your clipboard — an OSC 52 escape sequence (for example from a remote SSH host) could previously read the macOS clipboard without any prompt; kero now asks for confirmation first, matching the Ghostty app default (#8)
- Warn before pasting text that looks like it could execute commands, matching Ghostty's paste protection
- Add color themes: Settings → Colors picks a theme per appearance — kero's Default Light/Dark plus all 485 bundled Ghostty themes — recoloring the terminal, window chrome, sidebars, and editor live. The built-in Defaults keep the GitHub palette and translucent sidebar; every other theme colors the sidebar too
- Fix fuzzy-looking terminal text: font thickening was unintentionally always on, making glyphs heavier and softer than stock Ghostty
- Add a "Thicken font strokes" toggle in Settings → Font for those who prefer the heavier rendering

## [0.1.19]

- Fix a releasing signing issue

## [0.1.18]

- Fix max height of settings window

## [0.1.17]
